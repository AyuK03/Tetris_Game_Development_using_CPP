# Tetris_Game_Development_using_C++

🕹️🎮 This GitHub repository is home to the development of a Tetris game built with the C++ programming language and the raylib library. It is a learning project for me to get better understanding of OOPs concepts. It was also my first game that I developed from scratch.

💻🎨🎧 The game uses various raylib functions for graphics, input handling, and audio and can be played on Windows. 

🔍📖 The code is well-structured and easy to read. This is also one of my learnigs from developing this game, that is, how to write clean code and do proper abstractions wherever possible.

I will continue to add new and unique features to this game.
